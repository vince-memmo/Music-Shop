# Music_JS_Project

Background:
Music Shop is a user-friendly simplified version of DAW (e.g. GarageBand) that allows the user to workshop a chord and melody idea (i.e. a section of a chorus or verse) without any instruments on hand. Firstly, the user will have an option to choose a drum/percussion beat from a dropdown to back there song clip. Next the user will be able to loop different chords to form the chord progression (harmony) of the song clip. They will have the option to pick the key of the chord (C, D, B etc.), whether the chord is minor or major, and choose to make the chord dominant or not (add a 7th). Lastly, the user can improvise or home in a piano melody on the keyboard that will play over the drum and guitar loops.

The goal is not to be able to make an entire song, but rather flush out small chord-melody ideas that the user may have at a time that they do not have access to an instrument.

In Music Workshop, users are able to:

1. Loop a drum/percussion beat
2. Loop a chord progression on synthesizer which ustilizes Tone.js
3. Compose a piano melody by selecting notes on their key board
4. Change the tempo of their song clip
