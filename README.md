# Music_JS_Project

Background:
Music Shop is a user-friendly simplified version of DAW (e.g. GarageBand) that allows the user to workshop a chord and melody idea (i.e. a section of a chorus or verse) without any instruments on hand. Firstly, the user will have an option to choose a drum/percussion beat from a dropdown to back there song. Next the user will be able to loop different chords to form the chord progression (harmony) of the song. They will have the option to pick the key of the chord (C, D, B etc.), whether the chord is minor or major (a long term goal would be to add more variation to the type of chord), and choose from a limited selection of strumming patterns. Lastly, the user will be able to write a piano melody on the keyboard that will play over the drum and guitar loops. A bass option will also be included, but this will work similarly to the piano melody function.

The goal is not to be able to make an entire song, but rather flush out small chord-melody ideas that the user may have at a time that they do not have access to an instrument.

In Music Workshop, users will be able to:

1. Loop a drum/percussion beat
2. Loop a chord progression on a guitar that has a selected strumming pattern, chords, and duration of each  chord
3. Compose a piano melody by selecting notes on their key board
4. Compose a bass line by selecting notes on their key board
5. Change the tempo of their song clip

In addition, this project will include:
1. Instructions on how to make a song clip
2. Demo(s) of pre-made song clips
3. A README with greater detail into how the project works

Timeline

Friday: Create the drum and chord loops that the user will be able to access through the interface
Weekend: Create a simple interface that allows the user to create drum and chord loops.
Monday: Create a piano for the user to play melodies over the drum and bass loops
Tuesday: Make the interface visually correspond with what 
Wednesday: Polish up the interface and add a bass option if enough time is left.
Thursday: Finish last details and ensure the project is presentable
