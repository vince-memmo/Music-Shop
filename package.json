  "description": "Background: My end goal is to make a user-friendly simplified version of DAW (e.g. GarageBand) that will allow a user to workshop a chord and melody idea (i.e. a section of a chorus or verse) without any instruments on hand. Firstly, the user will have an option to choose a drum/percussion beat from a dropdown to back there song. Next the user will be able to loop different guitar chords to form the chord progression (harmony) of the song. They will have the option to pick the key of the chord (C, D, B etc.), whether the chord is minor or major (a long term goal would be to add more variation to the type of chord), and choose from a limited selection of strumming patterns. Lastly, the user will be able to write a piano melody on the keyboard that will play over the drum and guitar loops. A bass option will also be included, but this will work similarly to the piano melody function.",
